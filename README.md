The Installer installs Echo on Quest and PC

To use it, just go to the release page and download the specific build for either Windows, macOS or Linux.
After download you need to extract it and start the application.
The Installer itself should be pretty self explainable. If you have any questions, contact me on discord "marcel_one_"


Work in Progress!

This is my pre alpha release.

**We are happy to announce the new way of installing Echo on PC and Quest. I developed an easy to use installer. 
You will need a PC with Windows, macOS or Linux for it. With a bit of work also ChromeBooks with ChromeOS can work. An Guide for that will follow! **


# **1st Step:**
Download the newest available build for your operating system from the following GitHub page:
It might be possible that your OS is not available on the newest release. In that case, check the older releases!

# **2nd Step:**
### After downloading the application, you need to extract it.

## **On Windows:**
Open the .zip file by double-clicking on it and drag & drop the folder to a location such as your Desktop.

## **On macOS:**
macOS will automatically extract the file. Go to the next section.

## **On Linux:**
Open the .zip file by double-clicking on it and drag & drop the folder to a location such as your Desktop.

# **3rd Step:**
## **On Windows:**
Open the extracted folder and double-click on **EchoVR_Installer.exe** Windows might warn you as this is an unknown app. Click on **More info** and **Run anyway**
** (Screenshot 1 below)**

## **On macOS:**
As this is an unsigned application, you can't open the file with a simple double-click.
You need to press the **Ctrl** button while right-clicking on the application. Then, click on **Open**.
** (Screenshot 2 below)**

## **On Linux:**
Go into the `bin` folder inside the extracted folder and double-click on **EchoVR_Installer**.
