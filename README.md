The Installer installs Echo on Quest and PC

To use it, just go to the release page and download the specific build for either Windows, macOS or Linux.
After download you need to extract it and start the application.
The Installer itself should be pretty self explainable. If you have any questions, contact me on discord "marcel_one_"


Work in Progress!

This is my pre alpha release.

**We are happy to announce the new way of installing Echo on PC and Quest. I developed an easy to use installer. 
You will need a PC with Windows, macOS or Linux for it. With a bit of work also ChromeBooks with ChromeOS can work. An Guide for that will follow! **


# **1st Step:**
Download the newest available build for your operating system from the following GitHub page:
It might be possible that your OS is not available on the newest release. In that case, check the older releases!
https://github.com/BL00DY-C0D3/Echo-VR-Installer/releases

# **2nd Step:**
### After downloading the application, you need to extract it.

## **On Windows:**
Open the .zip file by double-clicking on it and drag & drop the folder to a location such as your Desktop.

## **On macOS:**
macOS will automatically extract the file. Go to the next section.

## **On Linux:**
Open the .zip file by double-clicking on it and drag & drop the folder to a location such as your Desktop.

# **3rd Step:**
## **On Windows:**
Open the extracted folder and double-click on **EchoVR_Installer.exe** Windows might warn you as this is an unknown app. Click on **More info** and **Run anyway**
** (Screenshot 1 below)**

## **On macOS:**
As this is an unsigned application, you can't open the file with a simple double-click.
You need to press the **Ctrl** button while right-clicking on the application. Then, click on **Open**.
** (Screenshot 2 below)**

## **On Linux:**
Go into the `bin` folder inside the extracted folder and double-click on **EchoVR_Installer**.

# **4th Step:**
## On the installer you have different options.
### The left side is PC (Windows) specific. Here you can do the following:

## **PC Install Echo:**
- In this menu, you can install Echo onto your Windows PC. **If you own Echo on your account, it's important you already downloaded and started Echo once from the Oculus software on your PC! Otherwise, your Echo license will not be available and you will get an entitlement error!**
- If you want to have the patched Echo on the original path used by Oculus, you need to set it inside the **PC Install Echo** menu. The path normaly is  ``C:\Program Files\Oculus\Software\Software``. As the path is inside the "Program Files" directory, you need to restart the application as an admin! To do this, close the app, right-click on **EchoVR_Installer.exe** and click on **Run as administrator**.
**     (Screenshot 1 and 2 below)**
- If you didn't own Echo on your Oculus account before Echo was canceled, you need to check the next section **(No license patch)**.

## **No license patch:**
- In this menu, you can patch your previously installed Echo installation to work even without owning Echo on your account.
- It should be pretty easy to understand everything here, as everything is explained.
- If you installed Echo in the path used by Oculus, you need to choose the path here. 
**     (Screenshot 3 below)**

## **Steam patch:**
- Here you can install Revive automatically to your Echo installation.
- It's normally not needed and should only be used if you use a **Steam-only headset** like the **Valve Index**.
- If you installed Echo in the path used by Oculus, you need to choose the path here.

### The right side is Quest specific. Here you can do the following:

## **Quest Install Echo (If you don't own Echo on your Oculus account, use the step below, instead of this one! (No license patch)):**
- **It's important that you have your developer mode enabled! You can check here on how to do that: https://learn.adafruit.com/sideloading-on-oculus-quest/enable-developer-mode**
- In this menu, you can install Echo onto your Quest.
- The first step is to click on the **Start Download** button and wait for the download to finish.
- The **OPTIONAL CONFIG** is, as it says, optional. If you need to have a different **config.json** than the one used for the Echo VR Lounge, you can do it here.
- Now you can click on **Install Echo to Quest** and it will automatically install Echo on your Quest.
- **Never press on restore inside your Quest!! It will remove Echo from your Quest.**


## **No licence patch (Only needed if you don't own Echo on your account!):**
- **It's important that you have your developer mode enabled! You can check here on how to do that: https://learn.adafruit.com/sideloading-on-oculus-quest/enable-developer-mode**
- Here you can install a **personalized** Echo version onto your Quest. As mentioned, it's personalized!!! Never share the APK!
- As all steps are explained in the installer, I will not do it here.
- **Never press on restore inside your Quest!! It will remove Echo from your Quest.**

# **5th Step:**

- Start Echo.
- You will see a code.
- Go to #command-central at the EchoVR Lounge https://discord.gg/echo-vr-lounge and enter the code by using the link-headset command
``/link-headset [4 digit code]``

# **6th Step: **

# You are done!
# Have fun playing Echo!
