The Installer installs Echo on Quest and PC

To use it, just go to the release page and download the specific build for either Windows, macOS or Linux.
After download you need to extract it and start the application.
The Installer itself should be pretty self explainable. If you have any questions, contact me on discord "marcel_one_"


Work in Progress!

This is my pre alpha release.

**We are happy to announce the new way of installing Echo on PC and Quest. I developed an easy to use installer. 
You will need a PC with Windows, macOS or Linux for it. With a bit of work also ChromeBooks with ChromeOS can work. An Guide for that will follow! **
