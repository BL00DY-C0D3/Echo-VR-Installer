The Installer installs Echo on Quest and PC

To use it, just go to the release page and download the specific build for either Windows, macOS or Linux.
After download you need to extract it and start the application.
The Installer itself should be pretty self explainable. If you have any questions, contact me on discord "marcel_one_"


Work in Progress!

This is my pre alpha release.
